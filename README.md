# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
For this project, I'll play as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make out apps available on Google Play and the App Store.
We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app â€“ the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. As of the second quarter of 2019, there were 2.46 million apps in the Google Play Store and 1.96 million in the Apple App Store. The competition is completely serious!

How many users will find our free mobile app? How many of them will download it? Potential users of our app should be able to quickly find it through search bar in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. Making our mobile app visible, easy to find, and successfully draw customers' attention are the mission of the Data Analyst team. 

## Project Goal
Analyze data to help my developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

In order to do so, I will need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store. I have two sample sized datasets, including 10,000 Android apps from Google Play (collected in August 2018) and 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store (collected in July 2017) that we can move in further in the analysis process.
